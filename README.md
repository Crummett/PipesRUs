# PipesRUs

Second year ADPROC (ADvanced PROgramming Concepts) coursework. 
Hand in December 2016.

Netbeans upload. Takes an order from the user and returns to txt files,
one as a receipt and the other as an order for the pipe company.

Structured somewhat illogically due to the nature of the coursework spec
(must demonstrate certain skills, etc). Uses Swing GUI.
